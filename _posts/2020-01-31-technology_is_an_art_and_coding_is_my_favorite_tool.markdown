As long as I can remember, I always had a fascination with technology, especially in the video game sector. Since a young
age I loved video games and the consoles that powered those video games. We didn't come from money, but I can't complain about that matter. My parents always provided us (I have two siblings ) with the necessary necessities of school and life. But one Christmas Eve we were able to convince them to buy us our first console. It was a Gameboy Advance SP and we basically shared a console that's meant to be used by one person. I still loved it nonetheless, it was something so amazing to me and that left a lasting effect that I would revisit later on in my life.


In high school I wasn't too sure what I wanted to do. I went from wanting to be a chef, to an author, to a business major. It wasn't until senior year where I decided I wanted to work in the technology sector. But I didn't just want to be in IT, I wanted something more challenging. I took a intro to C++ class in community college and I was hooked since then. Teacher was a bit strict and she had, in my opinion, a pretty close minded approach to coding. "You can try to learn software, but don't worry. If you can't do software there is always hardware." She made it clear that if a student wanted to pass they had to put a lot of effort and time. I did just that, and managed to pass the class. I think the satisfaction that came with the fact that I was able to pass the class was a huge boost towards my love for coding. But I think one of the most important parts about coding that I love is the fact that I can make something from scratch. I don't need physical material, or to invest money. I can build applications with simple words on a computer and being able to invent something without nothing, it's a concept I'm in love with.

I think this is the one of the best times to get into software development, the future belongs to those who can work with technology and keep evolving in the field. As time passes, civilization will keep becoming more and more advanced and having this skill will become an invaluable asset. I love coding, creating from scratch, thinking of new ways to solve problems and I can't think of doing anything else. Just as a painter loves expressing themselves on the canvas with their paintbrush, I hope to be able to express my love through my code. Thanks for reading!  - Oscar Z. aka Ozzy
